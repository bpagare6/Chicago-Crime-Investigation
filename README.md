# Chicago-Crime-Investigation
In this notebook, I have explored crimes in Chicago from a perspective of Chicago resident who wants to know more about the subject so he can better navigate his way through the city

## Motivation
**Crime in Chicago** is a very interesting topic for exploration for all kinds of reason. It has been always the topic of conversation among the residents of Chicago. Another important reason is the availability of huge amounts of publicly available high quality crime dataset open for Data Scientist to mine and investigate.

## Description
In this notebook, I am going to explore more about Crime in Chicago and try to answer few questions:
- How has crime in Chicago changed across years ? Was 2016 really the bloodiest year in two decades?
- Are some type of crime more likely to happen in specific locations or specific time of the day or specific day of week than other types of crimes ?
- What will be the safest place for me in Chicago ?

In this project, I analyzed large dataset containing 600K+ rows and 23 columns which you can get it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/currie32/crimes-in-chicago/data). And created pleasing visualizations considering various features.
